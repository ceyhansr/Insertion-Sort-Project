## Q [22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort "Type the process of the given array according to the expected sort type"
[22,27,16,2,18,6] [2,27,16,22,18,6] [2,6,16,22,18,27] [2,6,16,22,18,27] [2,6,16,18,22,27] [2,6,16,18,22,27]

## Q Note the Big O notation
O(n2)

## Q Time Complexity: Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle,Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end, Best case: The number we're looking for is at the very beginning of the array.

## Q What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted?
After the sorting process according to the insertion sort number 18 fall into average case, according to binary search number 18 fall into the best case 

## Q Write the first 4 steps of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15.6] according to Insertion Sort.
